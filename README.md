# Another Webpack Starter

###### An Webpack Startet Kit with some of the new technologies (**Webpack, Webpack dev server, Babel, ES2015, PostCSS**).

I follow a component base approach, this means that every part of the web is separate into its own component.

#### Getting Started

```
git clone <repo>
cd to <project>
npm install
npm start
```
Open the browser on `http://localhost:8080`
Edit code inside `client` folder

#### Requirements

* NPM
* WebPack
* PostCSS
* Babel

#### Technologies

* Live reloading with Webpack-dev-server
* Babel 6
* ESLint
* PostCSS
* Autoprefixer
* Feature flags

#### TO DO:

* prepare a production-ready build
* include a service example
* use angular-material

#### Inspiration

this project is a mix of ideas from different starters/projects out there that I like for me to use:

* [Scott Moss FrontendMasters Course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/angular-components-es6/) about Building an Angularjs app with a  *Component-based Architecture in ng1x + ES2015* **This course is a MUST**.
* [Kent C. Dodds webpack-angular project](https://github.com/kentcdodds/webpack-angular/tree/finished/step9-source-map): You can also check [his](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds) *Angular and Webpack for Modular Applications* course in [egghead.io](https://egghead.io/series/angular-and-webpack-for-modular-applications)
* [ArmendGashi/Webpack-starter-for-designers](https://github.com/ArmendGashi/Webpack-starter-for-designers): An Webpack starter kit for designers who want to kick off projects using Webpack ( Webpack, Webpack dev server, Babel, ES6+, PostCSS )
